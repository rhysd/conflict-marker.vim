Highlight, jump and resolve conflict markers quickly.

[conflict-marker.vim](https://github.com/rhysd/conflict-marker.vim) is Vim plugin for developers fighting against conflicts.
All features are available if and only if an opened buffer contains a conflict marker.

conflict-marker.vim does:
- highlight conflict markers.
- jump among conflict markers.
- jump within conflict block; beginning, separator and end of the block.
- resolve conflict with various strategies; theirs, ours, none and both strategies.
- support both `diff2` (Git default) and [`diff3`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Advanced-Merging) conflict styles.

This plugin tries to define some mappings if a conflict marker is detected.
If you don't want to use default mappings, set `g:conflict_marker_enable_mappings` to `0`.

## Installation

Please copy below files to corresponding directories in your "~/.vim" directory.

- plugin/conflict_marker.vim
- autoload/conflict_marker.vim
- autoload/conflict_marker/detect.vim
- autoload/unite/sources/conflict.vim (if you use unite.vim)
- doc/conflict-marker.txt

Please do `:helptags ~/.vim/doc` to generate help tags.

If you use a plugin manager, please follow its instruction and documentation to install.
For example, you can install this plugin with [neobundle.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim).

```vim
NeoBundle 'rhysd/conflict-marker.vim'
```

## Conflict Markers

Conflict markers can be customized using the following options:

```vim
" Default values
let g:conflict_marker_begin = '^<<<<<<< \@='
let g:conflict_marker_common_ancestors = '^|||||||\+'
let g:conflict_marker_separator = '^=======$'
let g:conflict_marker_end   = '^>>>>>>> \@='
```

## Highlight Conflict Markers

Conflict markers are highlighted by default. Use the following option to disable
highlighting:

```vim
let g:conflict_marker_enable_highlight = 0
```

Each conflict marker and conflict part is associated to a specific syntax group:

| marker / part | syntax group |
|------|--------------|
| begin conflict marker (`<<<<<<<`) | `ConflictMarkerBegin` |
| *ours* part of the conflict | `ConflictMarkerOurs` |
| common ancestors marker (`\|\|\|\|\|\|\|`) | `ConflictMarkerCommonAncestors` |
| common ancestors part of the conflict | `ConflictMarkerCommonAncestorsHunk` |
| separator conflict marker (`=======`) | `ConflictMarkerSeparator` |
| *theirs* part of the conflict | `ConflictMarkerTheirs` |
| end conflict marker (`>>>>>>>`) | `ConflictMarkerEnd` |

By default, `ConflictMarkerBegin`, `ConflictMarkerSeparator`,
`ConflictMarkerCommonAncestors` and `ConflictMarkerEnd` are
linked to the `Error` syntax group.
To link them to another syntax group, use the following option:

```vim
" Default value
let g:conflict_marker_highlight_group = 'Error'
```

`ConflictMarkerOurs`, `ConflictMarkerTheirs`, and
`ConflictMarkerCommonAncestors` are not linked to any syntax group by default,
and can be used to customize the highlight of the *ours* and *theirs*
parts of the conflict.

To use a specific highlight for each marker, disable the default highlight
group, and define your own highlights for each syntax group.

**Example:**

```vim
" disable the default highlight group
let g:conflict_marker_highlight_group = ''

" Include text after begin, common ancestors and end markers
let g:conflict_marker_begin = '^<<<<<<< .*$'
let g:conflict_marker_common_ancestors = '^|||||||\+ .*$'
let g:conflict_marker_end   = '^>>>>>>> .*$'

highlight ConflictMarkerBegin guibg=#2f7366
highlight ConflictMarkerOurs guibg=#2e5049
highlight ConflictMarkerTheirs guibg=#344f69
highlight ConflictMarkerEnd guibg=#2f628e
highlight ConflictMarkerCommonAncestorsHunk guibg=#754a81
```

## Jump among Conflict Markers

`[x` and `]x` mappings are defined as default. Use the following option to
disable them:

```vim
let g:conflict_marker_enable_mappings = 0
```

## Jump within a Conflict Marker

This feature uses matchit.vim, which is bundled in Vim (`macros/matchit.vim`).
`%` mapping is extended by matchit.vim. Use the following option to disable this
feature:

```vim
let g:conflict_marker_enable_matchit = 0
```

## Resolve a Conflict with Various Strategies

This plugin defines mappings as default: `ct` for theirs, `co` for ours, `cn` for
none and `cb` for both.  Use the following option to disable mappings:

```vim
let g:conflict_marker_enable_mappings = 0
```

### Theirs

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
ours
=======
theirs
>>>>>>> deadbeef0123
```

↓`ct` or `:ConflictMarkerThemselves`

```
theirs
```

### Ours

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
ours
=======
theirs
>>>>>>> deadbeef0123
```

↓`co` or `:ConflictMarkerOurselves`

```
ours
```

### Apply Both

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
ours
=======
theirs
>>>>>>> deadbeef0123
```

↓`cb` or `:ConflictMarkerBoth`

```
ours
theirs
```

### Apply Both in Reverse Order

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
ours
=======
theirs
>>>>>>> deadbeef0123
```

↓`cB` or `:ConflictMarkerBoth!`

```
theirs
ours
```

### Apply None

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
ours
=======
theirs
>>>>>>> deadbeef0123
```

↓`cn` or `:ConflictMarkerNone`

```
```
